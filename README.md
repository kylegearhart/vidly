A simple Node REST API written in Node.
This is a part of the Coding with Mosh course on Node.js.

I built this simply for the purposes of my education (mainly in Node.js and MongoDB).

##Running the App
Optionally, set the port it will run on:
```
export PORT=4999
```

Start Node JS runtime with nodemon for monitoring of source files and auto-restart on save:
```
nodemon index.js
```
